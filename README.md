> You'll be given a random number at the start of the game.
There are four crystals, each with their own random values that you'll use to add to your total score.
both the goal number and crystals get a random number generated after the player wins or losses- the goal number gets a random number between 19 and 120 and the crystals each get a random number between 1 and 12
the goal is to get the number without going over the goal. When you get the exact number- you get a score, and when you go over the goal- you lose by one and a new goal gets generated.
